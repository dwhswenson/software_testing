This directory contains supporting material for the talk on "Software
testing in scientific programming", as given by David W.H. Swenson at the
E-CAM Extended Software Development Workshop held in Leiden, Netherlands, in
August 2017.

To follow along with the examples (the "Live Demo!" slide from the
presentation), go in this order:

* `exceptions_and_assertions.ipynb`: Basic notebook covering exception
  handling in Python and assertions, including the conveniences from `nose`.
* `flow`: Learning how to run `nosetests` and the order in which various
  test fixtures are run
* `guided_tour`: A first example of adding tests until coverage is complete
* `your_turn`: A more complicated example of adding tests until coverage is
  complete
