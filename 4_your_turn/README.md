# Your turn! Exercises for Software Testing

Two exercises for software testing:

1. `word_wrap`: You're given a word wrap function. Write unit tests until
   you have full coverage!
2. `mathy_things`: An experience in test-driven development: Write methods
   that pass all the tests! (Don't change the tests.)
